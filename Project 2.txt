This project shows a data management system of a Hotel. In this project JSP and Servlets are used to interact with Database.
A webpage is created in which a GUI of database is present. This webpage is run on a TOMCAT server. 
This project also contains some files of servlets which was created just for learning purpose. In the concept of servlets there
are two methods named as doget and dopost. Both these methods contain request and response objects. When request comes from server
into servlet it is processed in servlet and then response is delevered to server from servlet.
Servlet usually interact with a page on server which i defined in UML pattern. This UML pattern is created by two ways
One way is annotation and other way is UML file. Annotation method came from v5 of java. 
So to create a web page we design a html file then in that html file we place a action to that accesible page of servlet.so 
that html file pass all parameters to servlet page from which servlet extract requests and write response on that servlet page.
BUt now in order for servlet to write data on html file we have to go to other option which is of jsp.
JSP is combination of java(servlet) and html on single file.
NOTE: Jsp is itself a servlet. all the methods writen in jsp is transfered to that doget method and then response is accordingly created but
all is done at back end.
